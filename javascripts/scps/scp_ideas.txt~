SCP-407   <-- anything living starts rapidly growing plants out of it. 
SCP-073 <-- plants within a radius of it die and disintegrate.
SCP-871  <-- is a cake. generates new cakes periodically if uneaten. new cakes have same properties (world eventually ends choked in cakes). New cakes don't necessarily look like old cakes. If eaten, respawns eventually (but only one). 
scp 008  basic zombie virus. spreads on contact (not airborn)
scp 417 plague tree (grows fruit that, if distrubed, releases a swarm of insects. if stung, you slowly die and in your corpse grows a new tree. original tree is imortal, subsequent trees are not).  insects don't live long.  insects have random appearance. spiders, bees, centipedes, flies. random num.


(famous scp (173?) that can only move when not looked at and leaves a gross trail?)

(that scp that causes anyone exposed to it to go blind/think they are blind and help it find new victims?)

(what about that one scp that was a dead body, that, if viewed, caused the viewer to eventually disappear and replace the body? how would i show that...)

(scp that causes you to write in your own blood until you die? would need to have more "does damage over time, and sets remover")

(what about that doctor/mask/thing? only 'attacks' sick individuals?)

spc 184 causes whatever it's contained inside to grow larger and larger (without effecting outside proportions) and eventually create new rooms of the same type.
